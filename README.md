# Module1-Challenge
This Module contains the work required for Module 1 challenge

## Section 1 - Overview of Project

Louise, a client, wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Her interest is to create the data and a visualization of the data in two areas:
Outcomes based on Launch Date
Outcomes based on Goals using a bracket chart.
The results are located below.

## Analysis and Challenges

I performed all the steps in the module.  I have no idea what you are looking for in this writeup so I will do the best I can. I would suggest that there be a sample document to demonstrate what is expected (an exemplar document or image of a document).  I have no training on github documentation and althought it is similar to html, the commands are not the same.  I also do not understand how to embed an image and how the link command would know how to link to an image on my computer. The images obviously have to be uploaded to a local drive or to a webpage that could be accessed thru a URL.  There were also several places in the instructions that took me awhile to figure out because the instructions would say something like the button on the right but there was no button.  I would say about 15-20% of the time I spend on this project was because I was trying to figure out what was being asked or the directions did not match what was on my screen.  I am not upset, just a bit frustrated.  For example, the syllabus on page 13 talks about the "ical link".  No clue what that is.  When I upload the project, I will try to upload the png files. My computer crashed several times doing this project.  Not sure why.

## Results

### Outcomes by Launch Date (see TheaterOutcomesLaunchDate.png)

1) Although there is a slight increase of success in the Spring, the major rate of successes happen over the summer months.  The summer months therefore carry the burden of the rest of the year.  

2) Failed projects seem to have less variation and are closer to an even percentage based on the month.  Therefore, a comparison by ratio of successful to failed projects increases during the summer month.  

### Outcomes Based on Goals (see OutcomesVsGoals.png)

1) In this chart, I came up with all zeros for the number cancelled and therefore the percentages were zero.  If this is true, then no projects were cancelled in the "plays" catagory.  The data would presume that putting on a play is profitable enough not to be cancelled based on the cancellation policy.

2) The percentage of the successful goals tends to increase as the dollar value of the goals increases.  The top end of the goals begins a downward trend so staying under the $50,000 catagory amount seems to be the correct decision.  The data would show a skew to the right so the data is not evenly distributed. 

### Limitations of the Dataset

Other data may be worthwhile to capture such as weather conditions or average daily temperature to see if there is a correlation to success of a project and Mother Nature.  Additionally, capturing the economic indicies may also provide insight as to the success, failure or cancellations of projects that are plays.

### Additional Graphs that may be helpful

Graphing a correlation of backers to success, failed and cancelled percentages may be interesting to see.
